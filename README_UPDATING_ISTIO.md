# How to sync with upstream Istio

1. Sync the upstream-istio branch with istio

```shell
# set this variable to the name of a branch from `istio/istio` you want to merge in
UPSTREAM_ISTIO_BRANCH=istio/release-1.7

git clone git@github.com:tetrateio/istio.git
cd istio/
git checkout -b upstream-istio

# compute diff between the HEAD and the last merged in commit from `istio/istio`.
# essentially, these are the changes that we need to apply on top of the latest state of `istio/istio`.
# some of the changes might have already been upstreamed.
# in practice, the diff is not that big. E.g., the diff from Istio 1.6.8 was the following:
#
# ```
# $ git diff --name-only $( grep '^commit ' UPSTREAM-SHA | awk '{print $2}' ) HEAD
#
# .circleci/config.yml
# README_CUSTOM_ENVOY_BINARY.md
# README_UPDATING_ISTIO.md
# UPSTREAM-SHA
# install/vm/Chart.yaml
# install/vm/charts/sidecar/Chart.yaml
# install/vm/charts/sidecar/templates/docker-compose.yaml
# install/vm/charts/sidecar/values.yaml
# install/vm/values.yaml
# operator/pkg/vfs/assets.gen.go
# pilot/pkg/model/service.go
# pilot/pkg/security/model/authentication.go
# pilot/pkg/serviceregistry/external/conversion.go
# pilot/pkg/serviceregistry/external/conversion_test.go
# pilot/pkg/serviceregistry/kube/controller/controller_test.go
# pilot/pkg/serviceregistry/kube/conversion.go
# pilot/pkg/serviceregistry/kube/conversion_test.go
# ```
git diff $( grep '^commit ' UPSTREAM-SHA | awk '{print $2}' ) HEAD >fork.diff

git remote add istio https://github.com/istio/istio
git fetch istio

git merge --strategy=recursive --strategy-option theirs ${UPSTREAM_ISTIO_BRANCH}

# manually merge remaining conflicts (by accepting their changes everywhere)

# ... your actions ...

git merge --continue

# apply the diff we created in the beginning
git apply --ignore-space-change --reject fork.diff

# manually resolve rejected chunks (e.g., because they have already been upstreamed)

# ... your actions ...

git commit -m 'apply fork diff'

# update UPSTREAM-SHA with info about the commit from `istio/istio` you've just merged in
git log -1 ${UPSTREAM_ISTIO_BRANCH} >UPSTREAM-SHA
git add UPSTREAM-SHA
git commit -m 'update UPSTREAM-SHA'

# compute the new diff from upstream istio and verify visually that is makes sense
git diff $( grep '^commit ' UPSTREAM-SHA | awk '{print $2}' ) HEAD >new.diff

# E.g., after upgrading from Istio 1.6.8 to 1.7.2 the new diff looked the following way
# ```
# $ git diff --name-only $( grep '^commit ' UPSTREAM-SHA | awk '{print $2}' ) HEAD
#
# .circleci/config.yml
# README_CUSTOM_ENVOY_BINARY.md
# README_UPDATING_ISTIO.md
# UPSTREAM-SHA
# install/vm/Chart.yaml
# install/vm/charts/sidecar/Chart.yaml
# install/vm/charts/sidecar/templates/docker-compose.yaml
# install/vm/charts/sidecar/values.yaml
# install/vm/values.yaml
# operator/pkg/vfs/assets.gen.go
# pilot/pkg/security/model/authentication.go
# ```
# Notice that it became smaller than before since some of the changes have been upstreamed.

# push the changes and open a PR against the default branch (`tcc` rather than `master`)
git push --set-upstream origin upstream-istio
```

2. On commit, a new build will automatially be created in Cicrcle CI, however, paused at a manual approval step.

Go to https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/tetrateio/istio and approve the build to get all Istio containers
rebuilt.

This step will reveal any merge conflict leftovers.

3. Alternatively, you can rebuild all Istio docker containers by running the `trigger_istio_release.sh` script below.

NOTE(yskopets): the following instructions didn't work for me as of September 2020.
                Maybe there have been some change on CircleCI side, but the job launched that way
                picks its configuration (normally, `.circleci/config.yml`) from somewhere else
                and fails because of that.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set +x
BRANCH=istio-update
SHORTSHA=`git rev-parse --short HEAD`
DATE=`date +"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M"`
TSB_VERSION=0.8.4
ISTIO_VERSION=1.7.2
TAG=${TSB_VERSION}-istio-${ISTIO_VERSION}-${SHORTSHA}
# istio version

echo $TAG

# MAKE SURE TO SET CIRCLE_CI_PERSONAL_API_TOKEN with the token from circleci
curl -X POST --header "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "build_parameters": {
    "CIRCLE_JOB" : "dockerpush",
    "HUB" : "docker.io/tetrate",
    "TAG" : '\"${TSB_VERSION}\"',
    "VERSION" : '\"${ISTIO_VERSION}\"'
  }
}
' "https://circleci.com/api/v1.1/project/github/tetrateio/istio/tree/${BRANCH}?circle-token=${CIRCLE_CI_PERSONAL_API_TOKEN}"
```

Wait for ~20 minutes for the images to build.

4. Get PR approved and merged into the default branch (`tcc` rather than `master`)

5. Update [dependencies.sh](https://github.com/tetrateio/tetrate/blob/master/dependencies.sh) in [tetrateio/tetrate](https://github.com/tetrateio/tetrate) with the `TAG` and the commit `SHA`.

6. It is encouraged to update the `istio.io/istio`'s replace entry in [go.mod](https://github.com/tetrateio/tetrate/blob/master/go.mod) to use the latest SHA of this repo (`tcc` branch).

```
$ go mod edit -replace istio.io/istio=github.com/tetrateio/istio@<LATEST_SHA_OF_THIS_REPO>
# For example
$ go mod edit -replace istio.io/istio=github.com/tetrateio/istio@23393db
```
