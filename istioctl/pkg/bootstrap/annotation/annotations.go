var (
	K8sCaRootCertConfigMapName = Instance{
		Name: "sidecar-bootstrap.istio.io/k8s-ca-root-cert-configmap",
		Description: `Name of the Kubernetes config map that holds the root cert of a k8s CA.

By default, config map is considered undefined and thus the only way to find out
the root cert of a k8s CA is
1) either to read a k8s Secret with a ServiceAccountToken, which among other things
   holds the root cert of a k8s CA
2) or to read the root cert of a k8s CA from the ` + markdown.InlineCode("/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt") + `
   file, which is auto-mounted into Pods by k8s`,
	}

	MeshExpansionConfigMapName = Instance{
		Name: "sidecar-bootstrap.istio.io/mesh-expansion-configmap",
		Description: `Name of the Kubernetes config map that holds configuration intended for those
Istio Proxies that expand the mesh.

This configuration is applied on top of mesh-wide default ProxyConfig,
but prior to the workload-specific ProxyConfig from ` + markdown.InlineCode("proxy.istio.io/config") + ` annotation
on a WorkloadEntry.

By default, config map is considered undefined and thus expansion proxies will
have the same configuration as the regular ones.`,
	}

	SSHHost = Instance{
		Name: "sidecar-bootstrap.istio.io/ssh-host",
		Description: `IP address or DNS name of the machine represented by this WorkloadEntry to use
instead of WorkloadEntry.Address for SSH connections initiated by the ` + markdown.InlineCode("sidecar-bootstrap") + ` command.

This setting is intended for those scenarios where ` + markdown.InlineCode("sidecar-bootstrap") + ` command
will be run on a machine without direct connectivity to the WorkloadEntry.Address.
E.g., one might set WorkloadEntry.Address to the ` + markdown.InlineCode("Internal IP") + ` of a VM
and set value of this annotation to the ` + markdown.InlineCode("External IP") + ` of that VM.

By default, value of WorkloadEntry.Address is assumed.`,
	}

	SSHPort = Instance{
		Name: "sidecar-bootstrap.istio.io/ssh-port",
		Description: `Port of the SSH server on the machine represented by this WorkloadEntry to use
for SSH connections initiated by the ` + markdown.InlineCode("sidecar-bootstrap") + ` command.

By default, "22" is assumed.`,
	}

	SSHUser = Instance{
		Name: "sidecar-bootstrap.istio.io/ssh-user",
		Description: `User on the machine represented by this WorkloadEntry to use for SSH connections
initiated by the ` + markdown.InlineCode("sidecar-bootstrap") + ` command.

Make sure that user has enough permissions to create the config dir and
to run Docker container without ` + markdown.InlineCode("sudo") + `.

By default, a user running ` + markdown.InlineCode("sidecar-bootstrap") + ` command is assumed.`,
	}

	ScpPath = Instance{
		Name: "sidecar-bootstrap.istio.io/scp-path",
		Description: `Path to the ` + markdown.InlineCode("scp") + ` binary on the machine represented by this WorkloadEntry to use
in SSH connections initiated by the ` + markdown.InlineCode("sidecar-bootstrap") + ` command.

By default, "/usr/bin/scp" is assumed.`,
	}

	ProxyConfigDir = Instance{
		Name: "sidecar-bootstrap.istio.io/proxy-config-dir",
		Description: `Directory on the machine represented by this WorkloadEntry where ` + markdown.InlineCode("sidecar-bootstrap") + ` command
should copy bootstrap bundle to.

By default, "/tmp/istio-proxy" is assumed (the most reliable default value for out-of-the-box experience).`,
	}

	ProxyImageHub = Instance{
		Name: "sidecar-bootstrap.istio.io/proxy-image-hub",
		Description: `Hub with Istio Proxy images that the machine represented by this WorkloadEntry
should pull from instead of the mesh-wide hub.

By default, mesh-wide hub is assumed.`,
	}

	ProxyContainerName = Instance{
		Name: "sidecar-bootstrap.istio.io/proxy-container-name",
		Description: `Name for a container with Istio Proxy.

If you need to run multiple Istio Proxy containers on the same machine, make sure each of them has a unique name.

By default, "istio-proxy" is assumed.`,
	}

	ProxyInstanceIP = Instance{
		Name: "sidecar-bootstrap.istio.io/proxy-instance-ip",
		Description: `IP address of the machine represented by this WorkloadEntry that Istio Proxy
should bind ` + markdown.InlineCode("inbound") + ` listeners to.

This setting is intended for those scenarios where Istio Proxy cannot bind to
the IP address specified in the WorkloadEntry.Address (e.g., on AWS EC2 where
a VM can only bind the private IP but not the public one).

By default, WorkloadEntry.Address is assumed.`,
